Hi, This is my first completely solo project (without tutorials or following some sort of guide or course)

Its not perfect, i did it in around 2 days, but it works for basic math problems, UI created using Tkinter

The plan is to add the following features:
    - better looking UI
    - carry on equations using answer as num1
    - adding more functions like MOD ect...

Thank you for viewing :)
